<h3>⚙ What is Data Science 🤔</h3>
<strong>Data is everything we perceive, describe.</strong>
<p>
For example, the population of Turkey is a data. The population of Germany, the population of the world, simply dogs, cats, houses, schools are all data. <br>
Although I have simplified the meaning of the term, actually "Data Science" is a broad concept that encompasses mathematics and statistics, custom programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.<br>
Data Science is collected under 3 main headings.<br>
<li>Data Analyst/li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Statistician</li> <br>
