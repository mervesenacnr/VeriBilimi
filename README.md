<h3>âš™ What is Data Science ðŸ¤”</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Data is everything we perceive, describe. </strong> <br>
For example, the population of Turkey is a data. The population of Germany, the population of the world, simply dogs, cats, houses, schools are all data. Although I have simplified the meaning of the term, actually "Data Science" is a broad concept that encompasses mathematics and statistics, custom programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. <br>
Data Science is collected under 3 main headings: 
  <li>Data Analyst</li>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
       <li>Statistician</li>
