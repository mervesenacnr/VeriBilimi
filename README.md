<h3>⚙ What is data and Data Science? 🤔</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Data is everything we perceive, describe. </strong> <br>
For example, the population of Turkey is a data. The population of Germany, the population of the world, simply dogs, cats, houses, schools are all data.<br>
Subcategories of data:
  <ol>
    <li>Numeric Data</li>
    <li>Categorial Data</li>
  </ol>
  When we look at Numeric Data closely we'll see:
   <li>Continous (Interval)</li>
    <li>Discerete (Ratio)</li>
  When we look at Categorial Data closely we'll see:
  <li>Binary</li>
    <li>Multiclass</li>
Although I have simplified the meaning of the term "data", actually "Data Science" is a broad concept that encompasses mathematics and statistics, custom programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract information and insights from structured and unstructured data. <br>
Data Science is collected under 3 main headings: 
  <li>Data Analyst</li>
   <li>Statistician</li> 
    <li>Machine Learning</li>

<h3>⚙ What is Machine Learning? 🤔</h3>

<p>
  <strong> It is a communication tool used to tell our requests to the computer.</strong> Deep Learning is a sub-branch of Machine Learning and Machine Learning is a sub-branch of Data Science.<br>
  Machine Learning has 2 areas:
  <li>Applied Machine Learning</li>
   <li>Machine Learning Research</li>

<h3>⚙ Let's learn some Data Science terms! 🦾🤖</h3>

<p>
  <li><strong>Supervised</strong>: Supervised learning is to take output from labeled models. 👉https://www.ibm.com/topics/supervised-learning</li> 
  <li><strong>Unsupervised</strong>: Unsupervised learning is grouping unlabeled models. 👉https://www.ibm.com/topics/unsupervised-learning</li>
  <li><strong>Regression</strong>: Estimated data are constantly variable. 👉https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regression.asp </li>
  <li><strong>Classification</strong>: Estimated data are in certain categories. 👉https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-classification</li> 
  Also you need to know that 😏:
  <li>Regression ≌ Classification.</li>
  <li>There is no absolute 0 reference in "interval", but there is in "ratio".</li>
  <li>There is no  contiuous variable.</li>
  <li><strong>Prediction</strong>: We have a lot of data and we try to correctly guess the answer to a question from this data. For example, we have data such as the height, leaves and color of a flower, and we can estimate whether the flower is poisonous by looking at these data.
  <li>Mapping: f(x1,x2,x3)= </li>
