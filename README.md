<h3>âš™ What is data and Data Science? ðŸ¤”</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Data is everything we perceive, describe. </strong> <br>
For example, the population of Turkey is a data. The population of Germany, the population of the world, simply dogs, cats, houses, schools are all data.<br>
Subcategories of data:
  <o1>
    <li>Numeric Data</li>

Although I have simplified the meaning of the term "data", actually "Data Science" is a broad concept that encompasses mathematics and statistics, custom programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract information and insights from structured and unstructured data. <br>
Data Science is collected under 3 main headings: 
  <li>Data Analyst</li>
   <li>Statistician</li> 
    <li>Machine Learning</li>

  <strong> It is a communication tool used to tell our requests to the computer.</strong> Deep Learning is a sub-branch of Machine Learning and Machine Learning is a sub-branch of Data Science.<br>
  Machine Learning has 2 areas:
  <li>Applied Machine Learning</li>
   <li>Machine Learning Research</li>
